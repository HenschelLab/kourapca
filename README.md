# Koura Ancestry
Ancestral Population analysis using Genotype Arrays for Koura/North Lebanon

## Conventional Principal Component Analysis
The following plots are meant to be interactive. Zooming, panning, and muting/unmuting of individual populations is possible, thanks to [bokeh](https://bokeh.org/).
Particularly, activate the desired tools to the right. Individual components are scalable, when mouse wheel zoom is activated and the wheel is used over the respective axis.
